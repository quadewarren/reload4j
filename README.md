## What is reload4j?

The reload4j project is a fork of Apache log4j version 1.2.17 in order 
to fix most pressing security issues. It is intended as a 
__drop-in__ replacement for log4j version 1.2.17. By drop-in, we mean 
the replacement of  _log4j.jar_ with _reload4j.jar_ in your build without 
needing to make changes to source code, i.e. to your java files.

With release 1.2.18.0 and later, the reload4j project offers a clear and
easy migration path for the thousands of users who have an 
urgent need to fix vulnerabilities in log4j 1.2.17.

### Building

<!-- building is closely related to source code so should be left here -->
<!-- any changes here should be reflected in the reload4j website as well -->

Reload4j builds with Maven and targets Java 1.5. You need to launch Maven under Java 8 or alternatively configure [Maven Toolchains](https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-using-toolchains.html) for Java 8.

A sample toolchains configuration can be found in [.github/workflows/toolchains.xml](.github/workflows/toolchains.xml).
